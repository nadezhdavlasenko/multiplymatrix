These are implementations of multiplying matrices. 
All of them use naive approach and are applicable only for square matrices.

1. Serial 
2. Parallel using ForkJoinTask for calculating each cell
3. Parallel using ForkJoinTask for calculating each cell but also for assigning tasks for each line

Parallel approaches use ForkJoinPool
